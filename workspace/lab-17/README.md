Parallel training with Stable Baselines 3

In this lab, you will implement parallel training using Stable Baselines 3 (SB3) to speed up the training process of a reinforcement learning agent. Parallel training allows multiple instances of the environment to run simultaneously, enabling the agent to collect more experience in less time.
